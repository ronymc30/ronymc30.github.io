## Rony's Data Science Portfolio  

### R Projects

#### 1. [Churn Analysis](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ronymc30/ronymc30.github.io/blob/master/telecomchurn.html)  
Analyze the churn of a major telecom company and identify the key drivers of churn. Then build the best model to predict churn and use the model to reduce churn while maximizing profitability.

#### 2. [Motion Classification](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ronymc30/ronymc30.github.io/blob/master/ActivityDetect.html)  
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.  

#### 3. [Multi-classification using a binary classifier](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ronymc30/ronymc30.github.io/blob/master/MultiLogistic.html)  
Use the ‘hepatic’ dataset of the AppliedPredictiveModeling library to demonstrate how to classify a multinomial response using a binary classifier. Also, evaluate a knn classifier and find the optimum value of k that yields the highest accuracy.
